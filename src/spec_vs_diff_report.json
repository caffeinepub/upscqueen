  "summary": "REQ-25 is partially implemented: the diff adds seeded NCERT and GCRT Study Material entries with book-like contentType and non-empty titles, and updates the frontend Study Material section to surface “textbook” items. However, the seeding logic shown does not demonstrate an “only seed when store is empty / no duplicates on repeated starts” guard.",

      "id": "REQ-25",
      "requirement": "Seed logic does not create duplicate entries on repeated canister starts within the same running deployment (e.g., only seeds when the store is empty).",
      "reason": "The added migration code unconditionally appends a fixed list of materials (using old.nextStudyMaterialId + offsets) and merges them into the existing store, with no check that the store is empty and no deduplication by title/url.",
