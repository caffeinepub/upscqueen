# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a public “UPSC Previous Year Question Papers” section to the upscQueen landing page with simple browsing structure and quick in-page navigation.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a new landing-page section titled “UPSC Previous Year Question Papers” that matches existing spacing, typography, and card/list styling.
- Display a static, browsable grouping for Prelims (GS Paper I, CSAT) and Mains (Essay, GS I–IV, and at least one Optional placeholder), with each item showing a clear label and a “View / Download” (or similar) affordance that indicates “Coming soon” when no files/links exist.
- Add a top-of-page (hero/top area) control labeled in English (e.g., “Previous Year Papers”) that scrolls/jumps to the new section.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can navigate from the top of the landing page to a “UPSC Previous Year Question Papers” section and browse Prelims/Mains paper categories with clearly labeled items and “Coming soon” placeholders where content is not yet available.
